# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Features

### Home Page

There is not much to show here (sorry). I had dreams of having some content here and a header, using links to redirect to the list and converter pages. 

### Currency List

This page is rendering the correct content. However, it looks bare in terms of styling - I would have used css modules here (maybe a framework such as Material UI instead for speed).

I have used semantic HTML here for accessibility but further work could be done to improve this.

I would also have added unit tests!

### Currency Converter

There is pseudo code here because of the time limit. I was able to fetch the correct data using Postman so I am confident that my approach would work as described.

Again, if I had some content, I would like to style and test as above.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
